### 6. Debugging Tips

If the streaming progress doesn't appear:
1. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
2. Check for any error messages
3. Look at the Network tab to ensure the streaming request is being made
4. Verify the response is coming back as `text/event-stream`

If the report doesn't display:

2. Verify the right panel is switching to 'report' mode
3. Check Console for any rendering errors
