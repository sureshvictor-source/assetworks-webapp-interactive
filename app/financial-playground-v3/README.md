# Financial Playground V3 - Test Route

This is a test route for the refactored Financial Playground architecture.

## Access

Visit: http://localhost:3001/financial-playground-v3

## What's Different

- **Architecture**: New Zustand-based state management
- **Components**: Modular ThreadSidebar, ChatPanel, ReportPanel
- **Code Size**: 198 lines (vs 1731 in original)
- **State**: 3 centralized stores (vs 24 useState hooks)

## Testing

Compare with original at: http://localhost:3001/financial-playground

All features should work identically:
- Thread creation/management
- Message sending
- Report generation
- Section editing
- AI Mode selection

## If Everything Works

Replace the old version:
```bash
cd app/financial-playground
mv page.tsx page-old.tsx
cp ../financial-playground-v3/page.tsx page.tsx
```

## Rollback

If issues found:
```bash
# Just delete this directory or keep testing
# Original page.tsx is untouched
```

---

**Status**: Ready for testing! ðŸš€
