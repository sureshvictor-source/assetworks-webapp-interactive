# NEXTAUTH_URL Fix Applied

## Issue Found
When logging in at `https://assetworks.netlify.app/auth/signin`, users were being redirected to `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/` (a placeholder URL).

## Root Cause
The `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable in Netlify was set to a placeholder value:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

## Solution Applied
Updated the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to the actual production URL:
```bash
netlify env:set NEXTAUTH_URL "https://assetworks.netlify.app"
```

## Deployment
Triggered a new deployment with an empty commit to apply the environment variable change:
```
Commit: ecddbce - "Trigger redeploy: Update NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable"
```

## Verification
After the deployment completes, the redirect should work correctly:
1. Visit: `https://assetworks.netlify.app/auth/signin`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. You should be redirected to the correct callback URL

## Environment Variables - Final Configuration

All environment variables are now correctly configured:

| Variable | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| DATABASE_URL | Neon PostgreSQL pooled connection | ✅ Correct |
| DIRECT_URL | Neon PostgreSQL direct connection | ✅ Correct |
| NEXTAUTH_SECRET | Generated secret key | ✅ Correct |
| **NEXTAUTH_URL** | **https://assetworks.netlify.app** | ✅ **FIXED** |
| GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID | OAuth client ID | ✅ Correct |
| GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET | OAuth client secret | ✅ Correct |
| ENCRYPTION_KEY | API key encryption key | ✅ Correct |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Claude AI API key | ✅ Correct |
| ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY | Stock data API key | ✅ Correct |
| COINGECKO_API_KEY | Crypto data API key | ✅ Correct |

## Next Steps
1. ⏳ Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
2. ✅ Test sign-in flow at https://assetworks.netlify.app/auth/signin
3. ⚠️ **Still required**: Update Google OAuth redirect URIs (see GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md)
