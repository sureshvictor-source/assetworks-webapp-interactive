```

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Showing?

1. **Check Console** (F12):
   - Look for: "HTML Reports found: X"
   - If X is 0, no reports have been generated yet

2. **Generate a Report First**:
   - The button only shows AFTER you have at least one HTML report
   - Make sure you're using a mode that generates HTML (Instant, Enhancement, NO QUESTIONS)

3. **Check Your Mode**:
   - Standard chat mode doesn't generate HTML reports
   - You need to be in a special mode (see methods above)

4. **Refresh Page**:
   - Sometimes a refresh helps after changing settings
   - Press F5 or Cmd+R

## Quick Test

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3004/ai-chat`
2. Click Settings ⚙️
3. Select: **"⚡ NO QUESTIONS Mode"**
4. Click: Apply
5. Type: "Analyze Apple stock"
6. Wait for HTML report
7. **Look at top-right of header** → Create Report button should be there!

## Visual Guide

```
Step 1: Settings → NO QUESTIONS Mode
Step 2: Type "Analyze Apple"
Step 3: Report generates
Step 4: Button appears in header (top-right area)
Step 5: Click "Create Report"
Step 6: Combined report opens in new tab
```

## Still Can't See It?

The button is in the **header bar**, not in the chat area. Look at the very top of the page, to the right of "AI Assistant" title, in the same row as the Settings button.

If you still can't see it after generating a report, open the browser console (F12) and check for any errors.
