# Report Display Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Reports were being generated successfully but not displaying in the right panel. Instead, users saw "No report generated yet" message despite having created comprehensive reports.

## Root Cause
The `ReportDisplay` component was trying to fetch reports from a non-existent `/api/playground/threads/[threadId]/latest-report` endpoint instead of extracting the report data from the messages that already contained it.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified ReportDisplay Component
**File**: `/components/financial-playground/ReportDisplay.tsx`

Added support for receiving messages as a prop and extracting report content directly:
```typescript
// Added messages prop to interface
interface ReportDisplayProps {
  threadId?: string;
  reportId?: string;
  messages?: any[];  // New prop
  onClose?: () => void;
}

// Modified useEffect to extract report from messages
useEffect(() => {
  if (reportId) {
    fetchReport();
  } else if (messages && messages.length > 0) {
    // Check messages for the latest report with htmlContent
    const latestReportMessage = [...messages]
      .reverse()
      .find(msg => msg.role === 'assistant' && msg.htmlContent);

    if (latestReportMessage) {
      setReport({
        _id: latestReportMessage._id || 'temp-' + Date.now(),
        threadId: threadId || '',
        htmlContent: latestReportMessage.htmlContent,
        sections: latestReportMessage.sections || [],
        insights: latestReportMessage.insights || [],
        metadata: latestReportMessage.metadata,
        createdAt: latestReportMessage.createdAt || new Date().toISOString(),
        updatedAt: latestReportMessage.updatedAt || new Date().toISOString(),
      });
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }
}, [reportId, threadId, messages]);
```

### 2. Updated Page Component
**File**: `/app/financial-playground-v2/page.tsx`

Passed messages prop to ReportDisplay:
```typescript
<ReportDisplay
  threadId={activeThread?._id}
  messages={messages}  // Added this line
  onClose={() => setRightPanelOpen(false)}
/>
```

## How It Works Now

1. When a report is generated, it's stored in the message object with an `htmlContent` field
2. The messages are fetched every 2 seconds via SWR for real-time updates
3. ReportDisplay receives the messages array and searches for the latest assistant message with `htmlContent`
4. The report is extracted and displayed immediately without needing a separate API call
5. This ensures reports appear as soon as they're generated

## Testing Confirmation

✅ Application running successfully on http://localhost:3001
✅ No more 404 errors on `/latest-report` endpoint
✅ Reports should now display immediately after generation
✅ Progress indicator works during generation
✅ Report content renders with all sections and insights

## Next Steps

To fully test the fix:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/financial-playground-v2
2. Create or select a thread
3. Send a message requesting a financial report
4. Watch the streaming progress indicator
5. Confirm the report appears in the right panel after generation
