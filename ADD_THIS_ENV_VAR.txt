# MISSING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE - ADD THIS TO NETLIFY

The site is still crashing because MongoDB URI is missing.
Even though we're migrating to PostgreSQL, some code paths still expect MongoDB.

ADD THIS TO NETLIFY:
=====================

Go to: Site settings → Environment variables → Add variable

Name:
MONGODB_URI

Value:
mongodb+srv://placeholder:placeholder@placeholder.mongodb.net/placeholder?retryWrites=true&w=majority

(This is a dummy value - won't actually connect but prevents crashes)

OR use a real MongoDB Atlas connection if you have one.

After adding:
1. Go to Deploys tab
2. Trigger deploy → Deploy site
3. Wait for build to complete

This should fix the 502 error!
